# Overview
I am writing a set of JSON parsers and writers in various languages as an exercise
in recursive-descent parsers and to do them in a couple of languages, in as idiomatic way
for each language that I can muster.

Intended languages:

  * Ruby
  * JavaScript
  * Clojure

May also do one for Scala.

*More here later* ...
